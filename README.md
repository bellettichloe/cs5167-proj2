## Smart Interface Ideas
**Dresser / Closet** - You can add clothes so the dresser knows what is available. You can pair clothing pieces together to form outfits. The dresser knows what clothes are clean and what outfits can be created based on what is available. Outfits can be categorized by weather, vibe, etc. so the dresser can suggest outfits based on those inputs.
